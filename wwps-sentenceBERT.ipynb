    "### Initial Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I used GloVe, an unsupervised learning algorithm, \"glove-wiki-gigaword-50\". \n",
    "    - There is a newer release and different versions of GloVe based on from different sources (corpus)\n",
    "    - Perhaps there is a range of corpora better suited to presidential speeches, which are more formally worded.\n",
    "2. The data dates back to 1789 as such, how language is used has changed. This may impact semantic-consistency across the corpora. \n",
    "    - And the results may be biased toward corpora from more modern time periods.\n",
    "    - Or the results may be biased to longer corpora\n",
    "3. Preprocessing should be reviewed so Regex and Tokenizaton can be optimized. \n",
    "    - Increasing stop words may have helped the performance (ability to detect meaning)\n",
    "4. This type of semantic search is limited by the quality of the user input. \n",
    "    - The more meaning conveyed in the query, the better the model can perform.\n",
    "5. Consider comparing the performance against Okapi BM25 Ranking or similar model that is tailored to Information Retrieval.\n",
    "6. Optimize code:\n",
    "    - I get a runtime warning with index[0] only for the sorted indices of similarity.\n",
    "7. Improve how I get the data from the user. There are no checks or error messages.\n",
    "8. I need to investigate how to prove the validity/performance of Text Similarity Models."
