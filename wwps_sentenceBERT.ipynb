    "\n",
    "- Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "    - The data is not labelled and we don't have a test set to validate our results.\n",
    "- Text Similarity\n",
    "    - We need to compare whether one set of text with another and determine their similarity.\n",
    "- Information Retrieval\n",
    "    - We need to fetch relevant sources of information from a corpus just like a quer or search on a search engine. Now that we know that we understand which steps to take to develop a suitable algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Text Similarity Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 main ways to analyse Text Similarity; Lexical Similarity and Semantical Similarity. We will select Semantical Similarity as in addition to syntax, the algorithm will consider context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps involved in Text Similarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Information Retrieval\n",
    "    - We need to define search term(query) and find a way to get input from the user.\n",
    "- Text Normalization\n",
    "    - Tokenize the sentences.\n",
    "    - Develop a method that can be used for both the search_ and the corpus.\n",
    "- Feature Engineering\n",
    "    - Our options here include Bag of Words, TF-IDF and Word Vectorization\n",
    "    - We will use a Word Embebbding Model and a Sentence Embedding Model\n",
    "- Similarity Measure\n",
    "    - We need to find an optimal measure.\n",

    "The dataset needs to be cleaned for e.g. in addition to President Speeches, the corpus included:\n",
    "- correspondence, notes about the speeches including the presidents' names, the dates and location of the speeches etc., audience response.\n",
    "- some of these could be removed easily, others may take considerable time.\n",
    "- I removed duplicate sentences in preparation for the Sentence Embedding Model.\n",
    "- This was not done for Word Embedding. So did not keep all variables controlled in interest of time.\n",
    "- There is an increase in the length of presidential speeches over time.\n",
    "- The John Adams inaugural address is an outlier.\n",
    "    - E.g. when given an idiom it was hard to interpret model performance.\n",
    "- The model may have performed better with more stop words. (Need to validate with more model runs.)\n",
    "- The quality (qualification) of the query matters with semantics.\n",

    "### Observations with SentenceBERT\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As observed in the Data Exploration section, Presidents' speeches are on average longer today that they were decades ago. So the sentence from the inaugural address by John Adam's is an outlier, having many run-on sentences.\n",
    "2. Specific areas for preprocessing improvements have been identified including:\n",
    "    - Removing telegrams and other alternative transcripts and correspondence, introductory and explanatory notes, the president's name and audience response etc\n",
    "    - In some cases this work is significant.\n",
    "3. In the time alotted I was able to limit the corpora analysed by the SentenceBERT model to Unique Sentences i.e. with no duplicates (as sometimes President's/people say somethine more than once.)\n",
    "4. The corpus was not prepared identically both the GLoVe and SentenceBERT.\n",
    "5. SentenceBERT did not accept pre-tokenized words. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations with GloVe\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I used GloVe, an unsupervised learning algorithm, \"glove-wiki-gigaword-50\". \n",
    "    - There is a newer release and different versions of GloVe based on from different sources (corpus)\n",
    "    - Perhaps there is a range of corpora better suited to presidential speeches, which are more formally worded.\n",
    "2. The data dates back to 1789 as such, how language is used has changed. This may impact semantic-consistency across the corpora. \n",
    "    - And the results may be biased toward corpora from more modern time periods.\n",
    "    - Or the results may be biased to longer corpora\n",
    "3. Preprocessing should be reviewed so Regex and Tokenizaton can be optimized. \n",
    "    - Increasing stop words may have helped the performance (ability to detect meaning)\n",
    "4. This type of semantic search is limited by the quality of the user input. \n",
    "    - The more meaning conveyed in the query, the better the model can perform.\n",
    "5. Consider comparing the performance against Okapi BM25 Ranking or similar model that is tailored to Information Retrieval.\n",
    "6. Optimize code:\n",
    "    - I get a runtime warning with index[0] only for the sorted indices of similarity.\n",
    "7. Improve how I get the data from the user. There are no checks or error messages.\n",
    "8. I need to investigate how to prove the validity/performance of Text Similarity Models."
